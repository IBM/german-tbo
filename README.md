We are releasing the data from our EMNLP 23 Demo paper. It is based on some publicly available German data source. We are not releasing the original data, and our annotation is based on providing line numbers into the original data. We are releasing the data under the `CDLA-2.0` license and the software under the `Apache-2.0` license.
